# Library Template (libtemplate)

`libtemplate` (short for 'Library Template') is a Python library that should be
used as a template to build one's own library, as the name suggests. In this
file you should provide a brief description of whatever library you decide to
create out of this template.

Visit the `libtemplate`
[website](https://mrfitzpa.github.io/libtemplate/_build/html/index.html) for a
web version of the installation instructions, the reference guide, and the
examples archive.

<!--
For those reading raw .rst files, see file `docs/INSTALL.rst` for
instructions on installing the `libtemplate` library as well as instructions for
compiling the documentation of this library.
